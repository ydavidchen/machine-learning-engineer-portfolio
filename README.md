# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program: Project Portfolio

## Overview

This is a repository consisting of projects for the Udacity [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t). I am grateful of the 30-day free trial period given by Udacity during the difficult times of `#COVID19`, encouraging programming enthusiasts like myself to `#STAYHOME` even more.

## Projects

1. Building sample Python3x package and publish to _PyPI_
2. Sentiment Analysis Model, deployed on _AWS SageMaker_
3. Plagiarism Detector
